# Prenetics Programming Assignment

## Installation Requirements

- C++ compiler and standard library ( C++17 )
- Nlohmann Json library ( https://github.com/nlohmann/json )

## Approach

In order to solve this assignement, I have used C++ Language and the nlohmann json library.
you can install it from here https://github.com/nlohmann/json

first of all, I included the AttendanceRegister json file in my CPP Console program. To work with this json file I have used nlohmann library. I parsed the json in C++ json object and then I used the json object to access the data. If no details are available for a particular Employee, I printed the message "No Details Available". I have also uploaded EXE file just in case you dont want to do the installation.
